We're so happy today because our first game is online now!     
[NiceFart.io](http://nicefart.io) is a online multiplayer game for browsers 
based in a hilarious world where the players are butts trying to beat other players
eating beans, and shooting farts.

This game is similar to agar.io or slither.io, games where your goal is eat and 
become the biggest player. For now, the game is available for browser, but we're working
hard to have soon versions for Android and iOS.

We made __NiceFart.io__ with love, and we hope you enjoy it!
